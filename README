Simple implementation of Breadth-First-Search Algorithm over a un-directed graph.
[ From Cormen book ]

TO-DO :
-------
>Implement the same algo with OOP concepts, I think the code would be much cleaner then.
>I think the code would not change for "directed" graph, but need to test this.
>Didn't consider the case of having "dis-connected" graph.
